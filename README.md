**heinzlab/smrna-seq-pipeline** is a bioinformatics best-practice analysis pipeline used for small RNA sequencing data at the Heinz Lab at UCSD. The pipeline is adapted from the nf-core set of Nextflow pipelines.

The pipeline uses [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a bioinformatics workflow tool. It pre-processes raw data from FastQ inputs, aligns the reads and performs extensive quality-control on the results.

This pipeline can be run on any Unix based environment that has Nextflow installed.
